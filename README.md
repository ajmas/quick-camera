QCamera
=======

QCamera is a simple utility to display the output from any of your cameras on your desktop. QCamera can be used for presentations where you need to show an external device (e.g. iPhone) to your audience via the USB camera. 

QCamera supports mirroring (normal and reversed), can be resized to any size, and the window can be placed in the foreground.

You can find the app on the Mac AppStore: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/qcamera/id598853070?mt=12
